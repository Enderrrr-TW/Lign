## About The Project

LIGN is a pytorch deep learning framework developed for continual lifelong learning, graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph-based machine learning

### Built With

LIGN is built on top of PyTorch with a focus on lifelong learning and graph-based machine learning

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

## Getting Started
